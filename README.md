# Process for a High Performance Multiple Montior Setup on Windows
I will keep track of my trials and tribulations, but most importantly, results of my proper or ideal multiple monitor setups for Windows using high performance consumer GPUs.

There are many complicated problems you will run into when trying to get multiple monitor setups going on Windows.  I have spent countless hours and spent so much money on cables and adapters in the past decades dealing with this.  I finally decided to keep track of my best conclusions and sort of a guide here for myself and anyone who wants a quick way to understand and deal with this.  It's not very easy googling around and finding everything.

## Equipment
 - A GPU with multiple outputs.  Since I am saying High Performance, I mean a good, modern GPU that gamers would us and that is popularly available at any given moment.  There are specialty cards out there that have like 6 outputs, but you can't game with them and they are like decades old now.  This is not for that kind of commerical applications (signage, etc).  This is for the typical home user who might use his GPU with his working PC as well as a nice 4k TV and other things around the house.  This is where it gets tricky.
  - HDMI Cables
  - DisplayPort Cables
  - Adapters
